# Lakes of Bengaluru

## A city once home to more than 2,000 lakes now has fewer than 200

## Why?
Illegal encroachment, dumping of debris in Bangalore’s water bodies, and climate change have resulted in many of the city’s 200 lakes disappearing. Some lakes are now a fraction of their original size or covered with algae. 

Although these lakes are an important source of water for the residents of the land-locked city, mismanagement by the government and a lack of planning has resulted in degradation of water quality.

Many of these lakes have undergone “rejuvenation projects” by the government but studies show that water quality remains an issue.

## Three visualizations

- **Map of lakes**: This interactive map helps visualize the lakes of Bengaluru and their pollution levels
- **Sankey chart**: This visualization shows the distribution of lakes that have undegone rejuventation programs by the city and their pollution levels.
- **Gauge chart**: This interactive visualization shows how much of the water treatment plants set up by the city are being used vs their capacity.


## Tools used

- **d3.js**: A JavaScript library for visualization

## Areas of improvement
- Add ticks to gauge visualzation
- Refine map further
- Make visualizations responsive
